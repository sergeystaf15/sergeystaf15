### Hello kids. Girls and boys! Dads and moms! Grandparents! Sisters and brothers! Loafers and slackers! Traders and fools! Miners and diggers!

Now it's time for me to break in. I came here for you to tear it up and spit it out and be such a f@ckin' mess!

Now forget it and read carefully. Read me every week, every month and probably every day. I am announcing my blog and will be for the rest of these times.
