### Hello kids. Girls and boys! Dads and moms! Grandparents! Sisters and brothers! Loafers and slackers! Traders and fools! Miners and diggers!

Now it's time for me to break in. I came here to rip, spit out, and be so f@cked up!

Now forget it and read carefully. Read me every week, every month and probably every day. I'm announcing my blog and will keep it up until the end of time.

<b>Day one~</b><br>
As usual, don't believe anyone right away, especially on a githab. I said I was going to blog and here I am a couple of weeks later, just sitting down at my desk chair.
Anyway, times are tough right now, I don't know if I should tell you anything at all, I mean don't write. Bullshit? Yeah.
In general I'm engaged in support of servers with nodes, in other words I am Nodrunner. Yes, it's really very promising and very nerve-racking and risky. For more than half a year I pull the gray hairs out of my head. There are very few of them left, I'm very funny now, but I keep believing and hoping, and most importantly, making money. Otherwise, what is it all for?

<b>Day 1001~</b><br>
Hello to all the brothers and sisters! Today on our show we're going to talk about Oiron Fish, Sui, Humanoid, and Massa.
1) Iron Fish. Cool node, always amazed by its greatness and now phase 2 has recently ended, you can take a break. Coins got very little, maybe enough for the bus fare! But Nodrunnership is not about money, it's about something more.
2) SUI. Getting through the lucky 500 and not noticing the letter in time at the post office is a rare gift. But the point of getting discouraged? Soon there will be a second phase, there and win back!
3) Humanode? Node to humans? Node is for robots who work without mistakes, that's what Humanode is. Just kidding, good project, promising.
4) Massa. Synchronization the first time? no. Sync on the second or maybe 100 times? no, f@ck off. It's already episode 17 of the sync struggle and there's no end in sight! And overall the project is stunning if you read more.

That's it, I'm done!

<b>Day 1039~</b><br>
The holidays are over, Christmas and New Year's Eve are over. It's sad and I'm really sad about it. But the good news is that SUI sent me an invitation to the second phase of the test and, of course, I am already participating in it. So I won't be distracted and I'll see you in a week.
