### Hello kids. Girls and boys! Dads and moms! Grandparents! Sisters and brothers! Loafers and slackers! Traders and fools! Miners and diggers!

Now it's time for me to break in. I came here to rip, spit out, and be so f@cked up!

Now forget it and read carefully. Read me every week, every month and probably every day. I'm announcing my blog and will keep it up until the end of time.

<b>Day one~</b><br>
As usual, don't believe anyone right away, especially on a githab. I said I was going to blog and here I am a couple of weeks later, just sitting down at my desk chair.
Anyway, times are tough right now, I don't know if I should tell you anything at all, I mean don't write. Bullshit? Yeah.
In general I'm engaged in support of servers with nodes, in other words I am Nodrunner. Yes, it's really very promising and very nerve-racking and risky. For more than half a year I pull the gray hairs out of my head. There are very few of them left, I'm very funny now, but I keep believing and hoping, and most importantly, making money. Otherwise, what is it all for?
